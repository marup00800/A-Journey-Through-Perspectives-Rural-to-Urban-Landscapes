Overview of the project:
The Rural to Urban Transition Visualization is an innovative OpenGL-based project
crafted for the Computer Graphics course at AIUB. It beautifully captures the essence of
transformation as rural landscapes gradually evolve into vibrant urban environments,
offering a visually stunning and immersive experience.
The journey unfolds across three distinct and captivating scenarios:
1. Village View: Step into the tranquility of the countryside, where rolling fields,
quaint cottages, and a peaceful atmosphere define the charm of rural life.
2. Highway View: Experience the pulse of connectivity as vehicles traverse a busy
highway, bridging the rural world with the promise of urban progress.
3. City View: Immerse yourself in the dynamic energy of a modern metropolis,
where towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and the hum of city life come alive
in vivid detail.
Through the power of OpenGL and GLUT, this project seamlessly integrates fluid
animations, transformational geometry, and harmonious background music to create an
engaging and sensory-rich experience. The Rural to Urban Transition Visualization
exemplifies the magic of computer graphics, showcasing its transformative potential in
education, simulation, and urban development.
Introduction:
A Journey Through Perspectives: Rural to Urban Landscapes" is an OpenGL project
that explores the dynamic transition from rural to urban environments. Through
immersive visualizations, the project showcases the contrasting elements of both
landscapes, highlighting the changes in scenery, architecture, and overall
atmosphere. Using OpenGL, the project creates a seamless journey, allowing
viewers to experience the transformation of the landscape from the simplicity and
tranquility of rural areas to the complexity and vibrancy of urban settings. The goal
is to provide an engaging visual experience that emphasizes the evolving
perspectives between the two worlds.
What have we implemented?
Scene 1: Village View
➢ Tiny houses will be placed across the scene to depict a rural setting.
➢ A school will be positioned near the village with a school bus and beautiful
playground , showing the daily rural life.
➢ A traditional tubewell will be added, serving as a vital part of rural water
supply, creating an authentic rural feel.
➢ Beautiful hills will be placed in the background to enhance the rural landscape.
➢ small boats will be placed near a river or water body, adding tranquility and
motion to the scene.
➢ A plane will fly across the sky.
Scene 2: Highway View
➢ A two-lane road was placed beside a river, making the scene more realistic.
➢ A steamer engine moved along the river, adding dynamic movement and
atmosphere to the scene.
➢ Various vehicles, such as cars, buses, and trucks, were added to make the
highway environment busier and more vibrant.
➢ The scene was set during the evening, with the sky transitioning to dusk,
adding depth and mood to the environment.
➢ Lamp posts were placed at the center of the two roads, giving the scene a
well-lit and organized appearance.
➢ Moving clouds were added in the sky, drifting slowly across the scene,
bringing life to the atmosphere.
➢ Small trees were placed along the middle of both roads, adding a touch of
natural beauty to the landscape.
Scene 3: City View
➢ A modern hospital will be added to the city, symbolizing healthcare in an urban
setting. An ambulance will move towards the hospital, depicting the city's
bustling environment.
➢ Tall skyscrapers will be added to reflect the urban development, giving the city
a modern and sophisticated skyline.
➢ A food court will be placed along the street
➢ A stunning mosque will be incorporated, reflecting the cultural and architectural
richness of the city.
